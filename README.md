# Concept-Bottleneck-LLMs

This is the extended and reproduced implementation of the paper: [Concept Bottleneck Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07992).  
We faithfully reproduce the CB-LLM classification pipeline and introduce two additional contributions:
- **NEC (Number of Effective Concepts) Analysis**: A new interpretability and sparsity evaluation inspired by the VLG-CBM paper, allowing us to study model efficiency under controlled neuron usage.
- **BCE-trained Concept Bottleneck Layer**: Support for training the concept bottleneck layer with binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss as an alternative to mean squared error.

This repo is adapted to run under limited GPU resources and includes updates to improve efficiency and compatibility. Detailed introduction can be found in our [Medium](https://medium.com/@yi.lien.elaine/reproduction-of-cb-llms-22e7c3130ddf).

## ðŸ“Š Part I: CB-LLM (Classification)

###  Automatic Concept Scoring (ACS)
To generate concept scores for a dataset, run:
```bash
python get_concept_labels.py
```

This will generate the concept scores for the SST2 dataset using our predefined concept set, and store the scores under `mpnet_acs/SetFit_sst2/`. Set the argument `--dataset ag_news` to switch the dataset.

**Updates:**

- Reduced `batch_size` for large datasets.
- Cast model weights and features to `float16`.
- Used efficient batching for tokenization.

### Train the Concept Bottleneck Layer (CBL)
To train the CBL, run
```bash
python train_CBL.py --automatic_concept_correction
```

This will train the CBL with Automatic Concept Correction for the SST2 dataset, and store the model under `mpnet_acs/SetFit_sst2/roberta_cbm/`. To disable Automatic Concept Correction, remove the given argument. Set the argument `--backbone gpt2` to switch the backbone from roberta to gpt2. Set the argument `--dataset ag_news` to switch the dataset.

**Update:**
Checkpoints are saved automatically to avoid losing progress if your connection breaks.

### Train the Final Predictor
To train the final predictor, run:
```bash
python train_FL.py --cbl_path mpnet_acs/SetFit_sst2/roberta_cbm/cbl_acc.pt
```

This will train the linear predictor of the CBL for the SST2 dataset, and store the linear layer in the same directory.
Please change the argument `--cbl_path` accordingly for other settings.
For example, without Automatic Concept Correction, the model will be saved as `cbl.pt`.

**Update:**
The code now supports more flexible backbone detection (e.g. both `roberta` and `gpt2` in string).

### Train the Baseline Black-box Model
To train the baseline standard black-box model, run
```bash
python finetune_black_box.py

```
This will train the black-box (non-interpretable) model for the SST2 dataset, and store the model under `baseline_models/roberta/`.
Set the argument `--backbone gpt2` to switch backbone or `--dataset ag_news` to switch the dataset.

**Update:**
Reduced batch_size for large datasets and added checkpoints.

### Testing
#### Test CB-LLM (classification)
To test the accuracy of the CB-LLM, run
```bash
python test_CBLLM.py --cbl_path mpnet_acs/SetFit_sst2/roberta_cbm/cbl_acc.pt
```
Please change the argument `--cbl_path` accordingly if using other settings. For example, w/o Automatic Concept Correction will be save as `cbl.pt`. Add the `--sparse` argument for testing with the sparse final layer.
#### Test the baseline black-box model
To test the accuracy of the baseline standard black-box model, run
```bash
python test_black_box.py --model_path baseline_models/roberta/backbone_finetuned_sst2.pt
```
Set the argument `--dataset ag_news` to switch the dataset. Please change the argument `--model_path` accordingly if using other settings.

### Generate Explanations from CB-LLM
To visualize the neurons in CB-LLM (task 1 in our paper), run
```bash
python print_concept_activations.py --cbl_path mpnet_acs/SetFit_sst2/roberta_cbm/cbl_acc.pt
```
This will generate 5 most related samples for each neuron explanation. Please change the argument `--cbl_path` accordingly if using other settings.

To get the explanations provided by CB-LLM (task 2 in our paper), run
```bash
python print_concept_contributions.py --cbl_path mpnet_acs/SetFit_sst2/roberta_cbm/cbl_acc.pt
```
This will generate 5 explanations for each sample in the dataset. Please change the argument `--cbl_path` accordingly if using other settings.

### Plot Top activated neurons from final layer
To get the top 5 activated neurons in CB-LLMs trained w/ ACC w/ Sparse FL in dataset SST2 (RoBERTa backbone), run
```bash
python visualize_neuron.py \
--dataset SetFit/sst2 \
--model roberta \
--w_path mpnet_acs/SetFit_sst2/roberta_cbm/W_g_sparse_acc.pt \
--b_path mpnet_acs/SetFit_sst2/roberta_cbm/b_g_sparse_acc.pt \
--top_k 5 \
--plot
```
This will store the sankey plot in `/classification/mpnet_acs/SetFit_sst2/roberta_plot`. Set the argument `--dataset ag_news` to switch the dataset. Please change the argument `--model`, `--w_path`, `--b-path`, and `--top_k` accordingly if using other settings. Add `--plot` to visualize and save the weights. For example,
<p align="center">
  <img src="./fig/sankey_top5_roberta_SetFit_sst2_W_g_sparse_acc.png" width="80%" height="80%" />
</p>

## ðŸ§ª Additional Experiments

### NEC (Number of Effective Concepts) Analysis
Our NEC analysis is inspired by the VLG-CBM paper ([VLG-CBM, arXiv:2048.01423](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01432)), which introduced NEC as a metric to evaluate model interpretability and efficiency under sparsity constraints. Here, we extend NEC to text classification with concept bottleneck models.

**What is NEC?**  
The Number of Effective Concepts (NEC) measures the average number of active concepts (neurons) used for each prediction.
- Smaller NEC means the model makes decisions based on fewer, more interpretable concepts.
- This analysis helps verify that high accuracy is not simply due to random or redundant concept usage.
- NEC also enables fair comparison between models with different sparsity levels.

**Our goals with NEC:**  
- Evaluate whether NEC is meaningful and useful for text classification.
- Determine if high accuracy can be achieved with fewer effective concepts.
- Show how accuracy changes under different NEC constraints.

To train and evaluate at various sparsity levels, run:
```bash
python train_FL_nec.py --cbl_path mpnet_acs/SetFit_sst2/roberta_cbm/cbl_acc.pt
```

This will train and evaluate the final predictor with different levels of sparsity (effective concepts), saving each configuration's weights and accuracy logs.

**Details:**

Use `weight_truncation` in `utils.py` and updated `glm_saga` in `glm_saga/elasticnet.py`.
Trains and saves model at `measure_level = (5, 10, ... 100)` effective concepts.
Stores results under `.../<backbone>_nec/`.


#### Test NEC accuracy for Black-box
```bash
python test_black_box_nec.py --model_path baseline_models/roberta/backbone_finetuned_sst2.pt
```
Evaluates NEC-constrained accuracy for black-box models, for comparison with CB-LLM.

### BCE-trained Concept Bottleneck Layer
To train CBL with BCE (Binary Cross Entropy), run
```bash
python train_CBL_bce.py --automatic_concept_correction
```
This will train the CBL using BCE with ACC for the SST2 dataset, and store the model under `mpnet_acs/SetFit_sst2/roberta_cbm/`. To disable Automatic Concept Correction, remove the given argument.
After this, you can follow the step in 'Train the Final Predictor' above to get the weights, and run the 'Testing' to get the accuracy.
